# Abstract

Recently, advanced technologies based on convolutional neural networks have been employed in fine-grained image retrieval, which can bring significant performance. However, most fine-grained image retrieval schemes attached importance to global features from the output of the last convolutional layer, which failed to consider local features from other convolutional layers. To this end, the existing model structures are defected in two aspects: (a) Lack of comprehensive utilization of global and local features. (b) More robust features are obtained by object detection methods with special attention. It is worth mentioning that we propose the method achieves similar functions of target detection at minimal additional computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel model structure, termed Selective Kernel Attention Network (SKA-Net), which comprehensively considers local and global features through a multi-scale structure, and considers local and global information in more detail and obtains more discriminative regions through the attention mechanism. Finally, we show that our approach outperforms favourably compared to the current state-of-the-art methods on the CUB-200-2011, CARS196 and In-shop Clothes Retrieval datasets.
